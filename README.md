# node.js---Rock-Paper-Scissors
WEB Multiplayer RPS game made with html and node.js

my name is Lahav Kasper, I made this game as my final project for a BootCamp course i took in Kinneret College
this is quite a simple node.js game of rock, paper and scissors, but it contains the basis of full stack programming, including a server side and an IO side.
in this game i used express an socket.io libraries for http and web communications.
im the game, there must be 2 active browsers for the game to start, the first player needs to wait until another player joins, and then the game can start.
the 2 players can choose 1 from 3 options: rock paper or scissors. only when all the players had made their desicion, the result is printed according to the game,
the winner gets a print of "winner" and the loser gets a print of "loser", the next game start right after the last game.
the players can also write un-related comments to the other player in the chat box.
